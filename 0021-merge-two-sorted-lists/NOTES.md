# Solution
1. Check if any or both lists are None, if so, return None or the one not None list.
2. Compare both list heads, choose the smaller one as the new head.
3. While both list pointers are not Null compare the next 2 elements and choose the smaller one to be appended to the tail of the new joined linked list.
4. When, at the end, one list pointer is not Null, append it to the new list.
